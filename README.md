# Data-Visualization-Challenge
Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Panda
#Imported all the dependencies
#merge the mouse metadata with study data
# cleaned the data having duplicated mouse Id and created another clean dataframe "clean_mouse_data"
#Calculated summary statistics.
#mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume
#Using the aggregation method, produce the same summary statistics in a single line
##generated  bar plots using pandas and pyplot both on identical data
#Calculated Quartiles, Outliers and Boxplots
#Refered to matplotlib quick start documentation https://matplotlib.org/3.7.1/tutorials/introductory/quick_start.html for charts.
#Refered to https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.linregress.html for regression analysis.
#used for loop and created empty list and append() function to locate the rows which contain mice on each drug and get the tumor volumes
#Calculated outliers using upper and lower bounds
#created box plots, scatter plots .
# Created a linear regression model with a regression equation and line to plot.
